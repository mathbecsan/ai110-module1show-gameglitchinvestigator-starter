# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

The first time I ran `streamlit run app.py`, the app loaded and looked normal (title, sidebar difficulty selector, a text input, three buttons), but playing it quickly showed it was broken in several ways. Running `pytest` first, before touching anything, also failed all 3 starter tests immediately with `NotImplementedError`, because `logic_utils.py` only contains stub functions — none of the real logic (`check_guess`, `parse_guess`, `get_range_for_difficulty`, `update_score`) actually lives there yet; it's all still sitting in `app.py`.

Four concrete bugs I found:

1. **Hints are backwards.** When `check_guess` decides the outcome is `"Too High"`, the message it pairs with that outcome is `"📈 Go HIGHER!"` — the opposite of what a "too high" guess should tell you. Same problem in reverse for `"Too Low"` → `"📉 Go LOWER!"`.
2. **The secret number changes type every other attempt**, which is the "commitment issues" bug the README hints at. In `app.py`, on even-numbered attempts the code does `secret = str(st.session_state.secret)`, turning the secret into a string, while the guess stays an `int`. This breaks the `==` win check (an `int` can never equal a `str` in Python) and breaks the `>` comparison, which raises a `TypeError` that gets caught and silently falls back to comparing the guess and secret as **strings**, so `"9" > "50"` evaluates to `True` (comparing the characters `'9'` and `'5'`) even though `9 < 50`. This is the direct cause of "you can't win" — a correct guess submitted on an even attempt is never recognized as a win.
3. **"New Game" doesn't fully reset the game.** Clicking it resets `attempts` and `secret`, but never resets `st.session_state.status`. So after winning or losing once, `status` stays `"won"`/`"lost"` forever, and the very next line of the app (`if st.session_state.status != "playing": ... st.stop()`) immediately halts the app again — "New Game" is effectively a dead button after your first win/loss.
4. **Score changes are inconsistent for the same outcome.** In `update_score`, a `"Too High"` guess adds `+5` to the score on even-numbered attempts but subtracts `-5` on odd-numbered attempts — the same mistake (guessing too high) is sometimes rewarded and sometimes punished depending on parity of the attempt count, which looks like the score randomly jumping around.

**Bug Reproduction Log**

I reproduced these directly by calling the functions as currently written in `app.py` (not by guessing at the behavior) — real console output below.

| Input | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Console Error / Output |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `check_guess(60, 50)` | Outcome "Too High" with a hint telling the player to guess **lower** | Outcome `"Too High"` paired with message `"📈 Go HIGHER!"` — hint contradicts the outcome | `('Too High', '📈 Go HIGHER!')` |
| `check_guess(40, 50)` | Outcome "Too Low" with a hint telling the player to guess **higher** | Outcome `"Too Low"` paired with message `"📉 Go LOWER!"` — hint contradicts the outcome | `('Too Low', '📉 Go LOWER!')` |
| Guess `9` vs secret `50`, on an even attempt (secret gets stringified to `"50"` by `app.py`) | Outcome "Too Low" (since 9 < 50) | Outcome `"Too High"` — wrong, because `"9" > "50"` compares the strings character-by-character (`'9' > '5'`), not the numbers | `('Too High', '📈 Go HIGHER!')` |
| Win the game, then click "New Game 🔁" | Game resets and lets you submit a new guess | App immediately re-shows "You already won. Start a new game to play again." and calls `st.stop()` because `status` was never reset to `"playing"` | No exception — just a soft-lock; confirmed by reading `app.py:134-145` |
| `pytest tests/` (before any fix) | Starter tests for `check_guess` pass | All 3 tests fail | `NotImplementedError: Refactor this function from app.py into logic_utils.py` (raised from `logic_utils.py:21`) |

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

I used **Claude Code** (Anthropic's AI coding assistant, running in my editor) as the primary AI teammate for this project, working file-by-file across `app.py`, `logic_utils.py`, and `tests/test_game_logic.py`.

**Correct suggestion:** After I marked the secret-stringification bug with a `# FIXME` comment in `app.py`, I asked the AI to trace where `check_guess`'s `TypeError` fallback branch was actually being exercised. It correctly identified that the `try/except TypeError` block in the original `check_guess` only existed to paper over `app.py` sometimes passing a stringified secret — and that the *real* fix was to stop stringifying the secret at the call site in `app.py`, not to keep patching `check_guess` to tolerate mixed types. I verified this was correct two ways: (1) I wrote a regression test, `test_low_guess_against_larger_secret_is_never_too_high`, asserting `check_guess(9, 50) == "Too Low"` — before the fix this case produced `"Too High"` because `"9" > "50"` is `True` as a string comparison; after the fix it passes; (2) I ran `streamlit run app.py` and confirmed the app starts without errors and the "Attempts left"/win logic no longer depends on attempt parity.

**Incorrect/misleading suggestion:** My first instinct (and the AI's first suggested approach) was to "just move `check_guess` into `logic_utils.py` unchanged" as part of the refactor step. That looked reasonable, but running `pytest` against the *starter* tests immediately showed it was wrong: the starter tests assert `check_guess(50, 50) == "Win"` (a plain string), while the original `app.py` version of `check_guess` returns a **tuple** `("Win", "🎉 Correct!")`. A tuple is never `== "Win"`, so a literal "just move it" refactor would have kept every starter test failing, just with a different error message than the `NotImplementedError` we started with. I caught this by actually running `pytest tests/ -v` and reading the failure instead of assuming the move was done once the import worked. The real fix was to split the function: `check_guess` now returns only the outcome string (matching what the tests expect), and a new `get_hint_message(outcome)` function separately maps the outcome to its display text — which is also where the swapped hint-text bug got fixed.

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

I treated "fixed" as meaning three things had to all be true at once: the specific regression test for that bug passes, the full `pytest` suite still passes (so the fix didn't break anything else), and the live Streamlit app starts and behaves sanely for that scenario. Before any fix, `pytest tests/ -v` failed all 3 starter tests with `NotImplementedError` (the stub functions in `logic_utils.py` hadn't been implemented yet). After refactoring the real logic into `logic_utils.py` and fixing the two targeted bugs, I re-ran `pytest tests/ -v` and got `6 passed in 0.01s` — the 3 original starter tests plus 3 new regression tests I added (`test_too_high_hint_tells_player_to_go_lower`, `test_too_low_hint_tells_player_to_go_higher`, `test_low_guess_against_larger_secret_is_never_too_high`). I also started the app with `streamlit run app.py --server.headless true` and confirmed with `curl` that it returns `HTTP 200` with no traceback in the server log, which told me the import refactor (`from logic_utils import ...`) didn't break anything at the app level, not just at the unit-test level. The AI helped design the regression tests by pointing at the exact `check_guess`/`get_hint_message` output that was wrong *before* the fix (e.g., `check_guess(9, 50)` returning `"Too High"` instead of `"Too Low"`), so each new test directly encodes "this specific wrong output must never come back" rather than testing something vague.
